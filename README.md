# Project Setup

## Check Node Installation

Ensure Node.js is installed and is the latest version:

```bash
node -v
```

## VSCode Plugins

1. "Prettier"

   To maintain code formatting consistency, install the Prettier plugin for VSCode. In the setup, choose the option "format on save".

## Run the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then nevigate to the local url shown below after running "npm run dev".

## Notes

I manually created the following folders:
"components" and "utils".

I also modified the App.tsx file.

Other files in the project can be ignored for now.
